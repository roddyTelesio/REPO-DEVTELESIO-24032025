    <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>The <code>&lt;c:PEG_FlowEmbed_CMP&gt;</code> component enables to execute
        a Flow within a tab (applying the standard SLDS white background) and control
        the termination of the Flow (to redirect the user to a record page).</p>
        <p>When using the standard default Flow URL, the User indeed gets a grey
        background and loops back to the start of the Flow when clicking on the
        termination, keeping the User on the Flow tab.</p>
        <p>This adressable Lightning component takes the following variables as input:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>c__flow</code>: Developer name of the Flow to be launched</li>
            <li><code>c__recordId</code>: Id of the record to be provided as input to the Flow
                (within its <code>recordId</code> input variable)</li>
            <li><code>c__target</code>: name if the Flow output variable providing the Id of the
                record to which the user should be redirected upon flow completion.</li>
            <li><code>c__label</code>: label to be set on the Flow tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typical use case is to use a flow to create a related object and redirect
        the user to the newly created object if successful, or back to the original
        record upon failure.</p>
		<p>The component may be typically launched from a
        <a href="/docs/component-library/bundle/c:PEG_ActionDisplay_CMP/documentation">
        <code>PEG_ActionDisplay_CMP</code></a> component with the following configuration:</p>
